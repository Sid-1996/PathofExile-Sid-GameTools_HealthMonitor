## 🧪 Initial Setup Recommendations

| Item | Operation |
|------|-----------|
| Health/Mana Monitor | Select area → Set percentage → Enable monitoring |
| Pickup Coordinates | Enter settings → Follow prompts to move mouse sequentially + Enter to confirm |
| One-click Clear | Capture inventory UI → Record empty color → Test F3 |
| Skill Combo | Define trigger key → Input skill sequence → Set delays → Enable |
| Auto Clicker | Hold Ctrl+Left Click to toggle state |

---

## 🧠 Feature Summary

### Health Monitor

- Captures specified area image each time and estimates percentage
- Multi-stage triggering (e.g., 80% / 50% / 30%)
- Trigger cooldown to avoid excessive key output

### Skill Combo

- Up to multiple independent configurations
- Each step has custom delay, adapts to skills and network latency

### One-click Clear / Pickup

- Determines valid slots through color differences
- Pickup clicks predetermined 5 points in sequence, suitable for fixed placement processes

### Auto Clicker

- High-frequency clicking (fixed short intervals), protects mouse button life, improves operation comfort

---

## ❓ FAQ (Concise)

**Q: Why don't hotkeys respond?** May have been globally paused (F9), press again to resume.

**Q: Clear doesn't work?** Confirm UI has been captured and empty color recorded, and inventory window is open.

**Q: Pickup function not executing?** Confirm all 5 coordinates have been set and you're in the correct scene.

**Q: Monitor values inaccurate?** Reselect area, ensure pure color sections are selected, avoid transparency and dynamic effects.

**Q: Antivirus false positive?** Add EXE to whitelist, as it has screen capture and keyboard monitoring behavior.
